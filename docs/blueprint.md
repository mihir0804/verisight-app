# **App Name**: VeriSight

## Core Features:

- Real-Time Contextualization: Displays hyper-localized information based on the user's current time and location (e.g., weather, news, local events).
- Claim Verification: Allows users to input a claim and initiate a verification process.
- Forensic Scan Simulation: Simulates an analysis of local news archives and municipal records to visualize the claim verification process.
- AI-Powered Credibility Assessment: The LLM tool will rate claims, weighing supporting evidence by source credibility (High, Medium, Low) from transparent evidence sources to reach a verdict (Verified, Misleading, False).
- Detailed Evidence Display: Shows a transparent list of supporting evidence with source and credibility rating for each.
- Source Credibility Rating: Rates the credibility of sources to foster digital literacy and critical thinking.
- Copy-Paste Integration: Allows users to quickly copy-paste claims from social media, messaging apps, or headlines for immediate verification.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#4B0082) to convey intelligence and sophistication. A high saturation emphasizes the command-center feeling.
- Background color: Very dark indigo (#1A0033) to enhance the sense of depth, allow UI elements to pop, and fit a late-night scenario. Visually similar to the primary, as requested, but nearly desaturated and darkened.
- Accent color: Electric violet (#8F00FF) for interactive elements and highlights, to bring attention where it's needed and match the intelligence theme. Brighter and more saturated than the primary, and with an analogous hue.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean, modern, and readable interface, suited for dashboard clarity and long-form text.
- Custom icons for weather and source credibility to improve visual understanding. Flat design with subtle color cues.
- Dashboard layout focuses on clear data presentation. Prioritize real-time information at the top, verification tools prominently placed, and evidence displays for transparency.
- Framer Motion for UI transitions and loading feedback. Implement a custom loading animation that evokes digital forensics and builds trust during verification. Gestures enable smooth interactions and provide intuitive control for mobile users.
